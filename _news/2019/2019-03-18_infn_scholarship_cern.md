I have been selected by the INFN (thanks to a [project](https://web.infn.it/csn1/index.php/it/14-home-articoli/48-borse-trimestrali-2019) named "La Fisica delle Particelle per esplorare l’Universo”) to pass three months at CERN to develop **generative models** useful for the simulation framework of LHCb.
