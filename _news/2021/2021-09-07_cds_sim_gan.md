I have presented a seminar at the [INFN-Firenze Division Council](https://www.fi.infn.it/index.php/it/consiglio-di-sezione) on the use of **GANs for Ultra-Fast Simulation** of the LHCb detector. Here are the [slides](https://agenda.infn.it/event/28041/contributions/142818/attachments/84241/111427/GANs%20for%20Ultra-Fast%20Simulation%20of%20the%20LHCb%20detector%20-%20CdS%2009.2021.pdf) [restricted access].
