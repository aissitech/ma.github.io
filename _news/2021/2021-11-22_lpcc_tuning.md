I have given a talk at the [LPCC Fast Detector Simulation Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1087522/) on hyperparameters fine-tuning powered by **OptunAPI**. Here are the [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1087522/contributions/4621867/attachments/2350079/4009450/20211122_LPCC_Tuning_LHCb_Barbetti.pdf) [public access].
