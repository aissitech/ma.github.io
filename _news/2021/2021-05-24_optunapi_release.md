[OptunAPI](https://github.com/mbarbetti/optunapi) is a simple API designed for Machine Learning applications that allows to distribute an automatic hyperparameters optimization over different machines through _HTTP requests_. Each set of hyperparameters can be studied independently since the minima research does't require any gradients computation, but instead is performed through a _Bayesian optimization_ based on [Optuna](https://optuna.org/). The machine running Optuna manages centrally the optimization studies -- the so-called "Optuna-server" -- providing sets of hyperparameters and assessing them by the scores evaluated and sent back by the single computing instance, named "Trainer-client". The HTTP requests underlying such client-server system are powered by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).
