Our work on the use of Machine Learning techniques for **Ultra-Fast Simulation** of the LHCb detector has been presented by Lucio Anderlini to the [LHCb Statistics and Machine Learning Working Group](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCbPhysics/LHCbStatistics). Here are the [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/996048/contributions/4216891/attachments/2203715/3728136/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques%20applied%20to%20the%20Ultra-Fast%20Simulation.pdf) [restricted access].
