  abstract={Detailed detector simulation is the major consumer of CPU resources at LHCb, having used more than 80% of the 
            total computing budget during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. As data is collected by the upgraded 
            LHCb detector during Run 3 of the LHC, larger requests for simulated data samples are necessary, and will far 
            exceed the pledged resources of the experiment, even with existing fast simulation options. An evolution of 
            technologies and techniques to produce simulated samples is mandatory to meet the upcoming needs of analysis 
            to interpret signal versus background and measure efficiencies. In this context, we propose Lamarr, a 
            Gaudi-based framework designed to offer to LHCb the fastest solution for simulations.
            Lamarr consists of a pipeline of modules parametrizing both the detector response and the reconstruction 
            algorithms of the LHCb experiment. Most of the parameterizations are made of Deep Generative Models and 
            Gradient Boosted Decision Trees trained on simulated samples or alternatively, where possible, on real data. 
            Embedding Lamarr in the general LHCb Gauss Simulation framework allows combining its execution with any of 
            the available generators in a seamless way. Lamarr has been validated by comparing key reconstructed quantities 
            with Detailed Simulation. Good agreement of the simulated distributions is obtained with two-order-of-magnitude 
            speed-up of the simulation phase.},

  title={Long-lived particle reconstruction downstream of the LHCb magnet},
  collaboration={LHCb Collaboration},
  author={null},
  abstract={Charged-particle trajectories are usually reconstructed with the LHCb detector using combined information from the 
            tracking devices placed upstream and downstream of the \(4~\rm{Tm}\) dipole magnet. Trajectories reconstructed using 
            only information from the tracker downstream of the dipole magnet, which are referred to as T tracks, have not been 
            used for physics analysis to date due to their limited momentum resolution. The challenges of the reconstruction of 
            long-lived particles using T tracks for use in physics analyses are discussed and a solution is proposed. The 
            feasibility of the experimental technique is demonstrated by reconstructing samples of long-lived \(\Lambda\) and 
            \(K^0_S\) hadrons decaying between \(6.0\) and \(7.6\) metres downstream of the proton-proton collision point. The 
            long-lived hadrons are selected using a data sample recorded between 2015 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated 
            luminosity of about \(6~\rm{fb}^{-1}\). These results open an opportunity to further extend the physics reach of 
            the LHCb experiment.},

            \(B^0 \to J/\psi (\to p\bar{p}) K^{*0} (\to K^+ \pi^-)\) and \(B^0_s \to J/\psi (\to p\bar{p}) \phi (\to K^+ K^-)\). 
            The branching fractions are measured to be \(\mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow p\bar{p}p\bar{p}) = (2.2 \pm 0.4 \pm 0.1 \pm

            In these measurements, the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic and the third one is due to the
            external branching fraction of the normalisation channel.},

            \(\Xi_c(2923)^0\) and \(\Xi_c(2939)^0\), whose masses and widths are measured to be \(m(\Xi_c(2923)^0) =

            a new \(\Xi_c(2880)^0\) state is found with a local significance of \(3.8\sigma\), whose mass and width

  abstract={The time-integrated \(CP\) asymmetry in the Cabibbo-suppressed decay \(D^0\to K^- K^+\) is measured using
            proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(5.7~\rm{fb}^{-1}\) collected
            at a center-of-mass energy of \(13~\rm{TeV}\) with the LHCb detector. The \(D^0\) mesons are required to
            originate from promptly produced \(D^{*+} \to D^0 \pi^+\) decays and the charge of the companion pion is
            used to determine the flavor of the charm meson at production. The time-integrated \(CP\) asymmetry is
            measured to be \(\mathcal{A}_{CP}(K^- K^+) = [6.8 \pm 5.4~\rm{(stat)} \pm 1.6~\rm{(syst)}] \times 10^{-4}\).
            The direct \(CP\) asymmetries in \(D^0\to K^- K^+\) and \(D^0\to \pi^- \pi^+\) decays, \(a^d_{K^-K^+}\)

            of these results with \(CP\) symmetry is \(1.4\) and \(3.8\) standard deviations for \(D^0\to K^- K^+\)
            and \(D^0\to \pi^- \pi^+\) decays, respectively. This is the first evidence for direct \(CP\) violation
