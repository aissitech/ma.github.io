  title={Hyperparameter Optimization as a Service on INFN Cloud},
  author={Barbetti, Matteo and Anderlini, Lucio},
  abstract={The simplest and often most effective way of parallelizing the training of complex Machine Learning 
            models is to execute several training instances on multiple machines, possibly scanning the 
            hyperparameter space to optimize the underlying statistical model and the learning procedure. 
            Often, such a meta learning procedure is limited by the ability of accessing securely a common database 
            organizing the knowledge of the previous and ongoing trials. Exploiting opportunistic GPUs provided in 
            different environments represents a further challenge when designing such optimization campaigns. In 
            this contribution we discuss how a set of REST APIs can be used to access a dedicated service based 
            on INFN Cloud to monitor and possibly coordinate multiple training instances, with gradientless optimization 
            techniques, via simple HTTP requests. The service, named Hopaas (Hyperparameter OPtimization As A Service), 
            is made of web interface and sets of APIs implemented with a FastAPI back-end running through Uvicorn 
            and NGINX in a virtual instance of INFN Cloud. The optimization algorithms are currently based on 
            Bayesian techniques as provided by Optuna. A Python front-end is also made available for quick prototyping. 
            We present applications to hyperparameter optimization campaigns performed combining private, INFN Cloud 
            and CINECA resources.},

  title={Lamarr: LHCb ultra-fast simulation based on machine learning models},
  author={Anderlini, L. and Barbetti, M. and Corti, G. and Davis, A. and Derkach, D. and 
          Kazeev, N. and Maevskiy, A. and Mokhnenko, S. and Siddi, B. G. and Xu, Z.},
  abstract={Abut 90% of the computing resources available to the LHCb experiment has been spent to produce simulated data 
            samples for Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The upgraded LHCb detector will be able to collect 
            larger data samples, requiring many more simulated events to analyze the data to be collected in Run 3. 
            Simulation is a key necessity of analysis to interpret signal vs background and measure efficiencies. The 
            needed simulation will far exceed the pledged resources, requiring an evolution in technologies and techniques 
            to produce these simulated data samples. In this contribution, we discuss Lamarr, a Gaudi-based framework to 
            speed-up the simulation production parametrizing both the detector response and the reconstruction algorithms 
            of the LHCb experiment. Deep Generative Models powered by several algorithms and strategies are employed to 
            effectively parametrize the high-level response of the single components of the LHCb detector, encoding within 
            neural networks the experimental errors and uncertainties introduced in the detection and reconstruction phases. 
            Where possible, models are trained directly on real data, statistically subtracting any background components 
            through weights application. Embedding Lamarr in the general LHCb Gauss Simulation framework allows to combine 
            its execution with any of the available generators in a seamless way. The resulting software package enables 
            a simulation process completely independent of the Detailed Simulation used to date.},
