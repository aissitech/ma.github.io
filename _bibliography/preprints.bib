            of \(30.8~\rm{nb}^{-1}\). The forward-backward ratio and the nuclear modification factors are measured together 
            with the differential cross-section as functions of the \(Z\) boson rapidity in the centre-of-mass frame, the 
            transverse momentum of the \(Z\) boson and a geometric variable \(\phi^∗\). The results are in good agreement with 
            the predictions from nuclear parton distribution functions, providing strong constraining power at small Bjorken-\(x\).},

  author={null},
  abstract={The interpretation of cosmic antiproton flux measurements from space-borne experiments is currently limited by the knowledge 
            of the antiproton production cross-section in collisions between primary cosmic rays and the interstellar medium. Using collisions 
            of protons with an energy of \(6.5~\rm{TeV}\) incident on helium nuclei at rest in the proximity of the interaction region of the 
            LHCb experiment, the ratio of antiprotons originating from antihyperon decays to prompt production is measured for antiproton 
            momenta between \(12\) and \(110~\rm{GeV}/c\). The dominant antihyperon contribution, namely \(\bar{\Lambda} \to p^- \pi^+\) 
            decays from promptly produced \(\bar{\Lambda}\) particles, is also exclusively measured. The results complement the measurement 
            of prompt antiproton production obtained from the same data sample. At the energy scale of this measurement, the antihyperon 
            contributions to antiproton production are observed to be significantly larger than predictions of commonly used hadronic 
            production models.},
