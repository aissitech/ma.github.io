  abstract={An exotic narrow state in the \(D^0 D^0 \pi^+\) mass spectrum just below the \(D^{*+} D^0\) mass threshold is studied 
            using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(9~\rm{fb}^{-1}\) acquired with the LHCb detector in 
            proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \(7\), \(8\) and \(13~\rm{TeV}\). The state is consistent with 
            the ground isoscalar \(T_{cc}^+\) tetraquark with a quark content of \(c c \bar{u} \bar{d}\) and spin-parity quantum 
            numbers \(J^P = 1^+\). Study of the \(DD\) mass spectra disfavours interpretation of the resonance as the isovector 
            state. The decay structure via intermediate off-shell \(D^{*+}\) mesons is confirmed by the \(D^0 \pi^+\) mass 
            distribution. The mass of the resonance and its coupling to the \(D^* D\) system are analysed. Resonance parameters 
            including the pole position, scattering length, effective range and compositeness are measured to reveal important 
            information about the nature of the \(T_{cc}^+\) state. In addition, an unexpected dependence of the production rate 
            on track multiplicity is observed.},

  abstract={Conventional hadronic matter consists of baryons and mesons made of three quarks and quark-antiquark pairs, 
            respectively. The observation of a new type of hadronic state, a doubly charmed tetraquark containing two charm 
            quarks, an anti-\(u\) and an anti-\(d\) quark, is reported using data collected by the LHCb experiment at the 
            Large Hadron Collider. This exotic state with a mass of about \(3875~\rm{MeV}/c^2\) manifests itself as a narrow 
            peak in the mass spectrum of \(D^0 D^0 \pi^+\) mesons just below the \(D^{*+} D^0\) mass threshold. The near 
            threshold mass together with a strikingly narrow width reveals the resonance nature of the state.},

  abstract={A search is performed for massive long-lived particles (LLP) decaying semileptonically into a muon and two quarks.

            \(10~\rm{GeV}\) up to about one half the Higgs-like boson mass. The second LLP production mode is directly from 
            quark interactions, with LLP masses from \(10\) to \(90~\rm{GeV}\). The LLP lifetimes considered range from \(5\)
