            to as \(X(3960)\), is observed in the \(D_s^+ D_s^-\) invariant-mass spectrum with significance greater than
            12 standard deviations. The mass, width and the quantum numbers of the structure are measured to be

  abstract={During Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the LHCb experiment has spent more than 80% of the pledged 
            CPU time to produce simulated data samples. The upcoming upgraded version of the experiment will be able to 
            collect larger data samples, requiring many more simulated events to analyze the data to be collected in Run 3. 
            Simulation is a key necessity of analysis to interpret signal vs background and measure efficiencies. The needed 
            simulation will far exceed the pledged resources, requiring an evolution in technologies and techniques to produce 
            these simulated samples. In this contribution, we discuss Lamarr, a Gaudi-based framework to deliver simulated 
            samples parametrizing both the detector response and the reconstruction algorithms. Generative Models powered 
            by several algorithms and strategies are employed to effectively parametrize the high-level response of the 
            single components of the LHCb detector, encoding within neural networks the experimental errors and uncertainties 
            introduced in the detection and reconstruction process. Where possible, models are trained directly on real data, 
            resulting into a simulation process completely independent of the detailed simulation used to date.},

            lymphoma (cHL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and grey zone lymphoma (GZL), using machine

            bulky disease and histopathological diagnoses who underwent FDG-PET pre-treatment. Volumetric and 
            radiomic parameters were measured using FDG-PET both for bulky lesions (BL) and for all lesions (AL)

            analysis showed significant differences between the lymphoma groups in terms of SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV,

  abstract={An exotic narrow state in the \(D^0 D^0 \pi^+\) mass spectrum just below the \(D^{*+} D^0\) mass threshold is studied

            proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \(7\), \(8\) and \(13~\rm{TeV}\). The state is consistent with 
            the ground isoscalar \(T_{cc}^+\) tetraquark with a quark content of \(c c \bar{u} \bar{d}\) and spin-parity quantum 
            numbers \(J^P = 1^+\). Study of the \(DD\) mass spectra disfavours interpretation of the resonance as the isovector 
            state. The decay structure via intermediate off-shell \(D^{*+}\) mesons is confirmed by the \(D^0 \pi^+\) mass 
            distribution. The mass of the resonance and its coupling to the \(D^* D\) system are analysed. Resonance parameters 
            including the pole position, scattering length, effective range and compositeness are measured to reveal important 
            information about the nature of the \(T_{cc}^+\) state. In addition, an unexpected dependence of the production rate 
            on track multiplicity is observed.},

            using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass 
            energies of \(7\), \(8\) and \(13~\rm{TeV}\), corresponding to an integrated luminosity 
            of \(8.4~\rm{fb}^{-1}\). The observables describing the angular distributions of the 
            decay \(B_s^0 \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-\) are determined in regions of \(q^2\), the square of 
            the dimuon invariant mass. The results are consistent with Standard Model predictions.},
